Foundations of Algorithms

USTC 2020 Fall

Here is the introduction:

```
In the Computer Science, the Algorithm is a computational procedure (or a sequence of computational steps) for solving a computational problem (with computers). This course introduces basic concepts of algorithms, and techniques for algorithm design and analysis,. The course will discuss several topics about advanced data structure and algorithms, such as basic analysis techniques, sorting, heap and priority queues, red-block trees, amortized analysis, binomial heaps, disjoint setsï¼Œdivide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, DFT and FFT, graph algorithms, string matching, and some concrete algorithms for typical computational problems that are efficiently solvable.
